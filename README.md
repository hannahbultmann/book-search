A command-line chatbot that helps you discover your next favourite book.
It uses tf-idf vectorization and cosine-similarity to compare your query with book descriptions stored in the dataset.
Instead of browsing through endless lists, talk to the playful "librarian" chatbot.

Based on data from the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps).
